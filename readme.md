Tamagotchi Project -- a blob's life

/* 
Page loads to a rectangle with a plain blob (think circle) inside. There will be a brief description of the games instructions:
"This is a blob.  Blobs are cool, but they do require some care.  As your blob grows, you'll have to keep it's belly full, play with it to keep it from getting too bored, and make sure it gets enough sleep! As your blob gets older, it will change and grow. Keep your blob happy, or else... For now, though, you can try to bond with your blob by feeding it some snacks and naming it."
User sees a prompt asking to name their blob.
The chosen name will appear above the blob's frame.
A single button appears under the blob.  
Each time fed (for 3 times), one of the following appears: "Feed me, I'm hungry!" "I'm still hungry!" "Yum, yum, extra yum!"
After the 3rd message, there will be a 3 second delay, then the blob will get eyes and a mouth.
A new set of 3 buttons will appear, as will a matching meter bar for each one: Hunger, Boredom, and Sleepiness.
Each button will have a name or image to represent it; food(donut), play(ball), sleep(Zzzz).
An 'age' will display at the top, next to the blob's name -- it will be 0 to start.  This will go up 1 year every 30 seconds.
Meanwhile, the 3 meters will all fill up slowly, and the user must click the corresponding button to keep it from filling up.
At year 3, the blob grows into an adolescent, gainging feet and short arms. The meters also begin to speed up.
At year 5, the blob grows into an adult, getting bigger and an antenna on it's head.
At year 6, a UFO will appear and beam the blob up, ending the game.
"The truth is out there." appears, as does a 'new game' button.
If the user fails to keep any meter from filling up all the way, the blob will get a sad face and shrink to nothing; "Your blob has melted away -- better luck next time!"; 'new game' button appears.
