User Story

The user is presented with a prompt to name their pet.

The pet appears, states it's name, and says it's hungry.

User must feed the pet, keeping it's hunger meter from reaching 10. Only 1 button.

After some feeding, the pet will 'bond' with the user, and now 3 options are available:
  - Hunger, Boredom, and Sleepiness, all with matching buttons to feed/play/sleep. 3 buttons now.

After x amount of time, the pet grows into an adolescent, which increases it's consumption.

After x amount of time, the pet grows into an adult.  It is then beamed up to a UFO and the game ends.
